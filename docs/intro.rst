Installing Numerical Libraries - NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib
=============================================================

Installing Numpy
---------------------
NumPy is a numerical library for Python.  It contains functions very similar to those found in Matlab, including convolution, digital filtering, and FFT.  

You may already have `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_
installed -- you can check by doing::

  python -c 'import numpy'

If you do not have NumPy installed visit the NumPy website and follow the directions to download for your operating system.  

Installing SciPy
----------------

SciPy is somewhat of an extension of NumPy and contains additional linear algebra functions and other numeric code.

You may already have `SciPy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_
installed -- you can check by doing::

  python -c 'import scipy'

If you do not have SciPy installed visit the SciPy website and follow the directions to download for your operating system.  

Installing Matplotlib
---------------------

You may already have `Matplotlib <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_
installed -- you can check by doing::

  python -c 'import matplotlib'  

Installing iPython and SciTools
===============================

Installing iPython
------------------

You may already have `iPython <http://ipython.org/>`_
installed -- you can check by doing::

  ipython     

If an interactive shell runs, you are done.

Otherwise visit the `download <http://ipython.org/download.html>` and simply run::
	python setup.py install

Installing SciTools
-------------------	  

Installing Database Tools - MySQL, MySQLdb, SQLAlchemy
======================================================

Installing MySQLdb
------------------

Visit the `MySQLdb <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/>`_ and download the tar file.

see :ref:`errors <mysqldb_errors>`.
